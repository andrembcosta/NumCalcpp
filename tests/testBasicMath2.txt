#testing the select, floor, ceil and round functions
#we will test their behaviors with positive, negative,
#integer and fractional numbers
define (s x y z) = (select x y z)
test(s 0 1 2)   1 #this is correct 0 is not negative, so, choose 1
test(s 1 1 2)   1 #this is correct again since 1 is positive
test(s -1 1 2)   1 #incorrect, as -1 is negative
define (fl x) = (floor x)
define (c x) = (ceil x)
define (r x) = (round x)
test(fl 10)  10 #correct, as 10 is an integer
test(fl 9.5)  9 #correct
test(fl -1)   -1 #correct, -1 is an integer
test(fl -1.4) -1 #wrong, since floor(-1.4) = -2
test(c 2.5) 4 #incorrect, since ceil(2.5) = 3
test(c -2.3)  -2 #correct
test(r 9.9)  10 #correct
test(r 9.51)  10 #correct
test(r 9.49) 10 #wrong, since 9.49 is closer to 9 than 10
test(r -2.52)   -3 #correct
test(r -2.1)   -2 #correct
